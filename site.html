    Joking actually, a whole bunch of big issues came up during the development of this project
	like the fact that during the first boss fight it would only let us attack once.

    Another issue we had in the making of the project is the issue that the branching paths wearnt working
	when attempting them, sometimes if the player hit 1 during an option it would send then much further back into the game or even skip them
	ahead to a path they didn't even choose
